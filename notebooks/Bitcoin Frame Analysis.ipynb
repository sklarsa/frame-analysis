    "This notebook explores the prominence and evolution of the metaphors, frames, and narratives used to when discussing Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frames, Metaphors, Narratives, Memes**:\n",
    "* currency: money, medium of exchange, FX, etc.\n",
    "* gold rush: pick axes, etc.\n",
    "* internet protocol: early internet, TCP/IP, etc.\n",
    "* ponzi scheme: pyramid scheme, etc.\n",
    "* tulip mania: bubble, craze, mania, madness of crowds, beanie babies, etc.\n",
    "* physical gold: limited supply, scarce, etc.\n",
    "* investment: asset, etc.\n",
    "* gambling: speculation, lottery, etc.\n",
    "* darknet: silk road, criminals, drugs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others that we might consider including:\n",
    "* distributed ledger: database (should we distinguish?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Words/phrases that would match multiple frames:\n",
    "* store of value: overlaps with currency and physical gold\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known Issues:**\n",
    "* We make no attempt to detect if someone is refuting a metaphor (or invoking the metaphor sarcastically)\n",
    "* Some of the frames are related, e.g., physical gold and asset. These will often co-occur in comments. We can decide later if we want to combine them. We just have to make sure we don't end up double counting, if we do\n",
    "* \"gold\" will pick up references to Reddit gold (magnitude)\n",
    "* Current \"IP\" rule will pick up \"BIP\" (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)\n",
    "* Need to match Reddit data vs known bots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sanity Checks (TODO):**\n",
    "* Check how score histogram shape compares to general comment shape\n",
    "* Check the effect of moderation policies (e.g., modding post calling it a tulip bubble)"
